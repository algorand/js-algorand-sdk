 *   * "safe": All integers will be decoded as Numbers, but if any values are greater than
 *     Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER an error will be thrown.
 *   * "mixed": Integers will be decoded as Numbers if they are less than or equal to
 *     Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, otherwise they will be decoded as BigInts.
 *   * "bigint": All integers will be decoded as BigInts.
 *
 *   Defaults to "default" if not included.
