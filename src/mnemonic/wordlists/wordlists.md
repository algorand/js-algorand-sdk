**Algorand Enhancement Proposal for Non-English Wordlists**

We need non-English wordlist options to fast-track the adoption of Algorand and its applications.

Wallets and applications like Jasiri Protocol - (https://jasiriprotocol.org) are going to take advantage of non-English wordlists to frictionlessly onboard users.

A request has also been made on go-algorand #5212

The English wordlist selected here remains unchanged
All other wordlists except Arabic and Indonesian, were originally done by Bitcoin developers under BIP-39
Arabic wordlist has been selected from https://arabeyes.org - Online Arab Linux/Unix Community
Indonesian wordlist has been selected from Google Code Archives 2011
