# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where did the `dist` folder go?

Starting with version 1.9.0, a minified browser bundle can be obtained from npm CDNs such as [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) or [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). The link can be found in the [README.md](README.md).

In prior versions, the browser bundles were made available in the `dist` directory. In order to access those, look in the `dist` folder on the version's GitHub tag, e.g. https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk/tree/v1.8.1/dist.

## Can I host the browser bundle myself?

Yes! If you would instead prefer to host the package yourself, a minified browser bundle can be found in the `dist/browser/` folder of the published npm package starting with version 1.9.0.
